Maximum factors formed by two numbers

Given a list of N numbers, Find two numbers such that the product of the two numbers has the maximum number of factors. Formally given n numbers a0, a1, a2, …..an. We are required to find two numbers ai and aj such that their multiplication gives the maximum number of factors and return number of factors of ai * aj
Constraints
1 <= N <=100
1 <= ai <= 10^8

Examples:

Input : [4, 3, 8] 
Output : 8
3*4 = 12 which has 6 factors
3*8 = 24 which has 8 factors
4*8 = 32 which has 6 factors
for ai, aj = {3, 8} we have the 
maximum number of factors 8
